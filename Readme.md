Tripsorter - core PHP, OOP concepts

1. index.php is the entry point where necessary objects are created.
2. the list of values I choose as array, though I could use any other format like JSON, but sorting alghorithms initially was done with arrays so I kept the tradition.
3. For unit testing I used codeception, though I prefer PHPUnit (Usually I write test first then functionality).
